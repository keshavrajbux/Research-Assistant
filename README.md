Project Name: Research Assistant using Metaphor API.

1. Brief Explanation of Project: 
A user gives a topic as an input and the result is a summarized version of text that explains in brief about the topic. This project was made with a view to find a summary for someone to understand what they want to learn.

2. How you Built it:
With Metaphor’s API, OpenAI’s API, based on user’s input relevant sources are found. Limited the number of links to access the web content to 5. Metaphor searches for relevant sources around the topic, OpenAI summarizes the text. Scraping and summarizing the content from the web results to get the desired output. Using Flask, deployed the webpage on a localhost server to access and view the desired results. User can enter the topic, and result is a summary to the topic.

3. Challenges/Feedback on the API: Scraping relevant URLs’ content to text based on input query was a little difficult. API has better results while searching for information or webpages, it was difficult for me to parse the consisting information in them towards the summary.

4. Why you’re interested in Metaphor: Metaphor’s search algorithm with a futuristic view to build more modern models that would make an impact has pushed me to apply here. In a start-up environment, with an assigned role there is also an opportunity to blend into other roles which would be a fresh challenge to explore beyond boundaries.
